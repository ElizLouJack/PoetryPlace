                    Poetry is inspired by a great many things. This could be to do with the life of the specific poet
                    there trials and tribulations or just something they've seen that specific day.
                    Some poets are war poets having used the horrors of what they ahve seen  to write about it.
                    These poets include, Wilfred Owen <em>Dulce et Decorum est</em>, Siegfried Sassoon <em>Dreamers</em>
                    and  John McCrae <em>In Flanders Fields</em>. Other poets have been inpired by nature such as W. H. Davies
                    <em>Leisure</em> and Wordswort <em>I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud</em>. Others are inspired by there plight
                    or that of others Maya Angelou <em>Still I Rise</em>. Whilst others jsut wish to impart wisdom which they wish
                    they already knew Rudyard Kipling <em>If</em>. From this we can conclude that no one thing can cause a person
                    to have inspiration to write poetry. The just have to choose something that speaks to them.

                    Some of the best peots are women. The likes of Dr Maya Angelou and Emily Dickens have inspired
                    many people with there thought out words to describe there lives.
                    Some of these women Have changed peotry in many ways such as: Audre Lorde who was dedicated to
                    fighting homophobia sexism and racism through poetry. 
                    These women have used wods to confront Social injustice and fight for our rights. Thet are inspirational.

                    Lots of people struggle with self expression. Constantly asking themselves  Who am i?
                    What do i stand for? and How can i show people who i am?. Many people show this wihout realising,
                    through the clothes they wear, how they speak and how they present themselves. But still even through
                    that many people still feel at a loss. Some peole have learnt to use arts and crafts, others sport.
                    Some people use mltiple methods to express themselves incluing poetry. One thing most people have learnt
                    is that you have to try multiple mediums to get to the one that feels right for you.
